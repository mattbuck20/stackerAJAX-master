**REQUIREMENTS**

HTML, CSS and JS for searching for unanswered questions was supplied. Students' task was to add the functionality to search for top answerers for a specific topic. 

-Users should be able to submit a topic they want to find top answerers for on Stack Overflow.
-The app should make an AJAX call to the appropriate endpoint on the StackExchange API (weâ€™ll point you to the right place in the docs in a moment).
-The DOM should be updated with information about top answerers (if any) after the response returns.
